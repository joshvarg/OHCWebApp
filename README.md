# OHC Web Application

A web application for OhioHealthCSE that interacts with patients, doctors, and administrators to help operations run smoothly.

## Description

The OHC web application is divided into three major parts: patients, doctors, and administrators. Patients can complete actions such as enrolling with OHC, booking appointments, and viewing bills. Doctors are able to register with hospitals, set their schedules, and specify the treatments that they offer. Finally, administrators have the onus of adding hospital information and editing treatment service fees for hospitals.
